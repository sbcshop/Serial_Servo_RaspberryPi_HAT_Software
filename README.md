The Serial Servo Raspberry Pi HAT is equipped with a range of versatile features. It offers multiple powering options, including a Type C power input for breakout use, as well as two alternative power sources through screw terminals and a DC jack, providing flexibility to suit your specific requirements.

Additionally, it boasts four Serial Servo connectors, each accompanied by four programmable buttons, enhancing its functionality. For added safety and convenience, an on/off switch is incorporated into the design. Furthermore, the HAT features a 1.14” TFT Display to provide clear status indicators, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
